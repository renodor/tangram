A simple Tangram game. My first try using Three.js

[Go to production website](https://tangram.herokuapp.com/)
(Because it is hosted in a basic Heroku plan, the app may take a few seconds to load the first time you launch it.)

### Built With
* [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) (Ruby 3.2.0 / Rails 7.0.3)
* [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
* [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/)
